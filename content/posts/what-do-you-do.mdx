title: What Do You Do?

My answer to the question **“What do you do?”** varies depending on who asks it. The answer I give to a fellow software engineer will focus on the nuances of my specific role and tech stack within my company. The answer I give to a non-technical person will be less specific and largely focus on the audience-facing product I work on (BBC World Service websites, like this [one](https://www.bbc.com/thai)).

Most of the time, this works out fine.

So, picture this. I was meeting a teacher friend in a pub, who was there with some of their other colleagues. They asked, “You’re a software engineer, right? What do you do?”. I gave a short, succinct answer, mentioning that I write code for websites and explaining what those websites are. The follow-up question was, “Yes, but what do you **actually** do?”

I know this friend well, and they are curious. They wanted to leave that conversation being able to visualise what I do all day. The same way you could do if someone told you that they are a teacher, or a doctor, or a plumber.

The challenge (as I chose to accept it) was to explain what’s involved when working in a technical role in a technical department to someone with no prior knowledge, being sure to avoid any jargon plus keeping it jovial and engaging.

Well I tried, and I failed. I probably got about 30 seconds in, and I could see in my friend's eyes that they had lost interest. I went in with a broad overview, maybe too broad. I hadn’t even mentioned myself yet by the time one of their colleagues cut me off. I lost my chance. The conversation moved on.

So, I’m having another go. I’m imagining explaining what I actually do to that teacher friend (hence some of the references). I’m also giving myself more than 30 seconds - but hopefully this time it’s more engaging so I won’t lose my crowd.

To summarise, the following is for someone who knows that:

- I am a software engineer
- I work for the BBC
- I work on World Service websites

And they:

- Are non-technical
- Have no prior knowledge of what it’s like working for a technical company or in a technical department

## What I actually do

Much like any 9-5 office job, my time is divided between working independently on tasks and attending meetings. There is a clear hierarchy of managers. I work closely with a team of other engineers, some more senior, some more junior.

The tasks I do usually involve writing code. Imagine the code for the website is a Google Doc\* document with 10,000 pages. I’ll spend a few hours writing and editing in the document. Once I’m done, I’ll save it as a draft. I’ll ask other engineers to review and check over what I’ve done. Once we’re happy, we’ll publish it.

About 80% of the work I do is decided by others in the company. For example, we get asked to add a new feature to the website. As engineers, it’s our job to know what code to write or edit to make it happen.

The other 20% is work that we as engineers decide to do. Since we’re the ones closest to the software, we’re in the best place to do this. For example, Google Docs introduces a new feature which makes writing code easier. We can write code that allows us to use it.

So largely in the meetings I attend, we discuss the work we’re going to do, break it down into smaller tasks for individual engineers to complete, and give feedback on how it’s progressing.

In addition to writing code and attending meetings, I’ll spend time using internal messaging tools. We’re one of many (let’s say 50) teams, and we rely on some of those teams. So, I’ll coordinate and collaborate with other people.

A smaller but more dramatic part of my job is responding when things break. For example, “oh no, Google Docs is down, no one can access our website!”. It’s never that dramatic. But we need to act quickly and coordinate with other teams to get things fixed.

Software is described as architecture and as a living thing. Both are true. Buildings are renovated, extended, and rebuilt. Living things grow and regenerate cell by cell. As a software engineer, I’m responsible for keeping our software stable and healthy as it evolves over time.

_\*I’m referencing Google Docs since my friend is familiar with GSuite. Other text editors are available._

## What do you think?

There are some sweeping (arguably inaccurate) statements in there. But I think it’s a good first attempt. Hopefully I get the chance to try this out soon, and I can improve it over time.
