As a software engineer and an artist, people often ask me how I can be both things at the same time. While these professions may seem very different, through experience I've come to see many similarities between them. In particular, I notice that the processes of creativity and coding have a lot in common.

## What do I mean by ‘Creativity’ and ‘Coding’?

**Creativity** is the ability to generate new ideas, solutions, or artistic expressions. For an artist, this means envisioning unique concepts, experimenting with different mediums, and transforming abstract thoughts into tangible works of art.

**Coding**, involves designing, writing, testing, and maintaining code to create software applications. For a software engineer, this requires collaborating with others, understanding user needs, and continuously learning new technologies.

## How are they similar?

Even though my creative and coding to-do lists look very different, there are qualities I bring to both. **Qualities** are the core traits that define a person or a thing. While they can be inherent, taught, or nurtured, these qualities go beyond just 'soft' or 'transferable' skills. In this context, they are the key traits that motivate and inspire me in both my artistic and technical work.

## Qualities that (in my opinion) complement both 'Creativity' and 'Coding'

### Curiosity

Curiosity drives the desire to create. It's about asking questions, wondering, and exploring.

For artists, curiosity leads to experimenting with new techniques, exploring different mediums, and seeking inspiration from the world around them. Curiosity drives software engineers to explore new technologies, understand complex systems, and stay on top of the fast-paced industry.

Asking "what if" questions leads to learning and innovation. No matter your pursuit or profession.

### Courage

Facing a blank page or a legacy code base can be daunting.

For creatives, it takes courage to start a new piece, experiment with unfamiliar techniques, and share their work with the world. Books like Art and Fear and The Artist's Way gave me valuable insights on overcoming these challenges.

In coding, courage is equally essential. It takes bravery to dive into new environments, tackle complex problems, and continuously learn new technologies. Software engineers must be willing to ask questions, seek help, and embrace the unknown.

### Iteration
