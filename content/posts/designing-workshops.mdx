By definition, a workshop is a structured and interactive session where participants engage in activities, discussions, and exercises. The purpose is to learn about a specific topic or develop skills.

Workshops take many shapes and sizes. In my opinion, the best ones see everyone getting stuck in and having a good time.

I’ve made a decent freelance career out of designing workshops, ranging from lino printing to bauble making, serving audiences of 8 to 300 people. Over the years I’ve developed a bit of a blueprint. Regardless of the theme or the context, there are a few key processes that help me.

## When designing a workshop, you need to answer these questions:

- Content: **What** will you be doing
- Format: **How** will you be doing it
- Audience: **Who** will be doing it
- Purpose: **Why** are they doing it
- Logistics: **When** and **Where** will you be doing it

Here is my playbook to help you answer these questions comprehensively. Note this focuses on in-person experiences.

## Write a brief

A creative brief is a document used to outline the strategy of a creative project. I’ve included this as the first (and probably most important) point. Mostly because it’s an opportunity to define all the sections above. But also because it’s rare that you’ll get provided with one, so it’s helpful to create your own.

In its simplest form, a brief will detail any Must and Must Nots to help you shape the content. E.g., for Audience, the workshop **must** be suitable for children. Or for format, the workshop **must not** take longer than 1 hour.

It’s ideal to gather this information as soon as possible. So whether your initial “briefing” takes the form of a meeting, a call, an email chain, or a solo brainstorm. Be sure to record answers and ask questions like:

- Is there a theme?
- Is there a key takeaway?
- Is there a target audience?
- Is there a price point/budget?

There are many more questions you could ask based on the content in this blog post.

## Format options

Assuming there isn’t a strict requirement outlined in the briefing phase, you may have flexibility in what the format should be.

In the context of workshops, the term "format" refers to the structure and organization of the workshop. This includes how the workshop is planned, scheduled, and conducted. The format outlines the sequence of activities, the types of interactions, and the methods used to deliver content and engage participants.

For example, within creative workshops, there are two main formats: ‘drop-in’ and ‘sessions’. In ‘drop-in’ workshops people start and finish at different times. In session based workshops, everyone starts & finishes at the same time.

You may also have some flexibility with seating arrangements. E.g., you may be able to have a few larger tables or many smaller tables. This can have an impact on things such as materials and group dynamics.

You might want people to be based in a single spot, or make multiple “stations” individuals can move between.

You might want people to work in the same group for an entire session, or make them move around so that they work with different people.

I’ve outlined lots of options here. That’s because format and content go hand in hand. But format is more tangible and less variable than content. Usually there are more restrictions, such as the number of tables available, and the expected headcount. So, I find it easier to define the format first. And then think how I can marry content to that.

## The Fun-damental purpose

This relates to the purpose of the workshop (which you will hopefully have defined in the briefing stage). This could be many things. **However**, I’m going to generalise here and say there is one key way to measure the success of your workshop.

My sweeping statement: Whoever is **funding** the workshop, wants the people doing the workshop to have **fun**. Whether it’s for developing brand loyalty, keeping employees engaged, or because it’s a ticketed workshop and people paying naturally want to have a fun time.

Whilst the purpose is likely a desired outcome such as people will leave having learnt something, solved a problem, or developed a skill. The content should aim to fulfil this, but never at the expense of a fun and positive experience.

## Content

So, you have your brief and a few format ideas, and you know it needs to be fun. But you might still be thinking; “what do I actually do in my workshop?!”. Well, like a creative process, there is no absolute blueprint on how to come up with an idea. However, here are some processes I use which might help:

- Word/ idea/ visual association
  - This can help make abstract concepts literal. Think about how Graphic designers and illustrators have done this. Think about how you use emojis to do this all the time.
  - Think about abstraction as a way to distil complexity down to a simpler version. For example, a game of chess could represent a battle. A map is an abstraction of real terrain.
  - If you have a few ideas, you could find connections between them. For example, something that connects Biology and Valentines Day is a heart.
- Brainstorming
  - Brainstorm all your ideas. Are there two or three that you could develop further? Or combine into one idea you could develop further?
- The Internet
  - Is there some key learning or outcome you can start by researching? Allow yourself to explore rabbit holes.
  - Whilst I highly discourage trying to reinvent the wheel. Beware of Googling “workshop ideas”. You risk finding yourself in an echo chamber. Try to think outside of the box, especially during initial ideation.
- Put yourself in the shoes of the audience
  - If you were walking into this workshop, what would you find fun? Easy? Surprising? Challenging? New? Familiar?
- Ask friends/family
  - Tap into the wealth of diverse opinions and experiences

## You can’t please everyone

Depending on your audience, it’s likely that different people will take different things away. You could compare it to snorkelling vs scuba diving. Some people will stay at surface level and not engage too deeply. Others will want to dive in and explore every opportunity.

Naturally as the person creating the workshop, you will be gleefully thinking about the scuba diver who enjoys the intricacies and craft of a well-designed experience. But do take a moment to think of the snorkellers, who may walk into your workshop having already decided it’s a total waste of their time.

Is there still a takeaway for them, even if they don’t partake? For example, could they meet someone new? Is the barrier to entry low enough so even the least enthusiastic can’t refuse having a go? Is there a way for them to “rebel” within the context of the workshop?

It’s certainly not a requirement, but it can be a fun challenge. To get the balance between something prescribed enough so the outcome is clear, but open to interpretation enough to permit spontaneity (or rebellion). To be totally honest, one of my favourite things about running workshops is being surprised by the outcomes!

## Materials

It may be yourself and/or someone else who is responsible for providing materials. The benefit of providing your own is that you know exactly what you’ll have to work with on the day. The downside is that it’s more work to organise and possibly transport.

It’s good to understand what materials are essential and what are nice to have. Then have a rough plan if any materials are missing on the day. (Even if that means running to the nearest stationary store).

I’m also in the habit of writing a packing list for every workshop in case I need to run it again in the future.

## Access, risks, hazards

I’ve grouped these together, not because they’re not important. More because they could have a whole blog for themselves (likely with a more serious tone).

By access, I mean making your workshop accessible. By risks, I mean the risks that threaten the success of your workshops. And by hazards, I mean things that pose a danger to the people doing your workshop.

Ask questions during the briefing stage and feedback sessions. Be prepared as much as you can in advance and be prepared to be flexible on the day.

Something I like to do (when relevant) is ask: “What workshops have worked well in the past?” and (more usefully): “What workshops HAVEN’T worked well?” This can give you an idea on potential risks that you can be sure to mitigate.

## Signage

By signage, I mean posters, instruction sheets, worksheets etc. My general rule of thumb is to provide signage and written instructions that would allow someone to complete the workshop, without any facilitators present.

This is particularly important for drop-in workshops, where people are coming and going. In a session-based workshops, you can usually give an introduction talk or presentation to cover the basics.

Even if people can’t take instruction sheets home with them, you can encourage them to take a picture.

## Share your thought process and invite feedback

This is less critical than writing your own brief. But I still recommend sharing your brief with any stakeholders. It gives them the chance to check your understanding and interpretation.

I will often write an initial brief, an idea proposal and then a finalised brief. This will specify my decided format and content and details any risks I see to be involved.

I will share these with stakeholders at each stage and invite feedback.

## Reflect, learn and adapt

Once the workshop is complete, take some time to reflect on how it went. What went well? What could you have done differently? This will help if you ever want to run the same workshop again.

Did you forget something? Or didn’t need something? Here you can update your packing list

## Good luck!

I’m going to sign this off with an example of a workshop I designed.

## Example

### Valentine's Day Card Making Workshop

The purpose of the workshop was to educate and engage participants about scientific research related to a “love” hormone. Specifically, a hormone called Kisspeptin, and clinical trials involved measuring the bodies reactions to different erotic stimuli, such as chocolate, perfume and porn. This area of research hopes to help adults with low libidos.

The theme was Valentine’s Day. The format was a drop-in session. The audience was primarily adults but could be all ages and were likely to be from a scientific background (as opposed to an arts background).

In the workshop I designed, participants made a Valentine’s card which revealed their heart’s “deepest desires”. It consisted of worksheet styled to look like a scientific chart, folded into an origami heart.

Here you can see me using idea association - the heart is an easy cross over between biology and Valentine’s Day.

You can also see me using abstraction. Here, I translated complex scientific research into a simple playful worksheet. Participants of the workshop are alike to participants in clinical trials. Using the worksheet, participants could pick their own stimuli and plant red kisses (X’s) to show how much they liked each one.

The “scuba divers” could complete all aspects of the workshop and further decorate the card. For the “snorkelers”, they could either fill in the worksheet or just create an origami heart without completing the worksheet.

I picked origami as I deemed it to be a novel and accessible creative process that would appeal to a scientific audience. Since origami can be done by following step-by-step instructions, it has a lower barrier to entry than something like drawing might have.

Since the worksheet was folded up, it gave people the chance to be explicit or playful. This made it suitable for all ages, without sanitising the erotic nature of the research.

(There was a further meaning to people’s “Kisses” being folded up, since Kisspeptin is named after Hershey’s kisses - but I might be going too meta with this).

This workshop has received very positive feedback from both stakeholders and participants.
