As a software engineer and an artist, people often ask me how I can be both things at the same time. While these professions may seem very different, through experience I've come to see many similarities between them. In particular, I notice that the processes of creativity and coding have a lot in common.

## What do I mean by ‘Creativity’ and ‘Coding’?

**Creativity** is the ability to generate new ideas, solutions, or artistic expressions. For an artist, this means envisioning unique concepts, experimenting with different mediums, and transforming abstract thoughts into tangible works of art.

**Coding**, involves designing, writing, testing, and maintaining code to create software applications. For a software engineer, this requires collaborating with others, understanding user needs, and continuously learning new technologies.

## How are they similar?

Even though my creative and coding to-do lists look very different, there are qualities I bring to both. **Qualities** are the core traits that define a person or a thing. While they can be inherent, taught, or nurtured, these qualities go beyond just 'soft' or 'transferable' skills. In this context, they are the key traits that motivate and inspire me in both my artistic and technical work.

## Qualities that (in my opinion) complement both 'Creativity' and 'Coding'

### Curiosity

Curiosity drives the desire to create. It's about asking questions, wondering, and exploring.

For artists, curiosity leads to experimenting with new techniques, exploring different mediums, and seeking inspiration from the world around you. Curiosity drives software engineers to explore new technologies, understand complex systems, and stay on top of the fast-paced industry.

Asking "what if" questions leads to learning and innovation. No matter your pursuit or profession.

### Courage

Facing a blank page or an unfamiliar code base can be daunting.

For creatives, it takes courage to start a new piece, experiment with unfamiliar techniques, and share your work with the world. Books like Art and Fear by David Bayles and Ted Orland and The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron gave me valuable insights on overcoming these challenges.

In coding, courage is equally essential. It takes bravery to dive into new environments, tackle complex problems, and continuously learn new technologies. Software engineers must be willing to ask questions, seek help, and embrace the unknown.

### Ideation

Ideation is the heart of creating, as it all starts with generating ideas.

Artists use ideation to envision new concepts, develop new techniques, and find unique ways to express their thoughts and emotions.

For software engineers, coding allows you to quickly turn new ideas into reality, whether it's creating a new application or fixing a technical problem.

The book Big Magic by Elizabeth Gilbert reframed how I view ideation. (Gilbert suggests that ideas are living entities that seek out human collaborators. It's not for everyone - but it works for me!)

### Iteration

Ideas don't always have to be totally original. Iteration is about learning the skills, recognising patterns, and applying others' ideas to your own solutions.

For artists, this means revisiting and reworking your creations, tweaking your techniques, and learning from each attempt.

In coding, iteration is equally important. It involves refactoring code, optimising solutions, and learning from each development cycle. The principles of KISS—"keep it simple, stupid"— and DRY—"don't repeat yourself"— emphasises the importance of simple solutions and reducing redundancy in code.

For both creativity and coding, iteration emphasises the process of continuous improvement and refinement.

### Flow

Flow, often described as being "in the zone," is a state of deep focus and immersion in an activity.

Personally, I find being in a flow state incredibly fulfilling and helpful for maintaining focus, whether I'm creating a drawing or solving technical problems. (That said - it can be slightly dangerous—like when you're going round in circles trying to solve a bug that you just can't figure out, and suddenly two hours have flown by!)

However, I believe enjoying and spending long periods of time trying to figure something out is beneficial for both creativity and coding.

### Balancing Process and Product

Understanding the balance between Process and Product is crucial for both artists and software engineers.

Think of it like the saying, "It's not about the destination, it's the journey." The journey represents the process—the day-to-day aspects of creating, experimenting, and problem-solving. The destination, or the product, is the end result of these efforts.

For artists, focusing solely on the product can stifle creativity. The process of creating art involves making mistakes and learning from them. Similarly, in coding, being too fixated on the final product can hinder learning. The process of coding involves debugging and refactoring, which help develop strong programming skills.

However, the product does matter. It's the tangible outcome of your hard work. For artists, it's the finished piece that can be shared with the world. For software engineers, it's the functional software that solves a problem or meets a need.

Balancing process and product means appreciating the journey while keeping an eye on the destination. Valuing them equally ensures that the efforts put into the process lead to meaningful and impactful product.

### Problem 'Defining'

Being able to define problems, not just solve them, is important for both creativity and coding.

I'm not sure what to call this quality, since it goes beyond problem-solving. Problem 'defining' involves identifying and framing the right problems to tackle.

The book Range by David Epstein describes problems as 'Kind' or 'Wicked,' with 'Kind' problems being straightforward and 'Wicked' problems being complex and multifaceted.

Artists and software engineers both commonly face 'Wicked' problems. For an artist, it could be a large-scale installation with a tight timeline and budget. For an engineer, it could be the migration of a complex legacy system.

Once shaped and properly defined, complex problems can be broken down into smaller problems and tackled individually.

### Questioning

Asking questions of others and oneself is essential for growth, learning, and problem-solving.

For creativity and coding, it is important to become comfortable with asking questions and seeking help when required.

### Nurturing

Finally, we come to nurturing. Whether it's the seed of an idea, a moment of inspiration, or a whim to try something out, it is important to create a safe space to nurture these sparks.

For artists and software engineers, this involves providing an environment where experimentation is encouraged, and mistakes are seen as learning opportunities.

Within creativity and coding, individuals should feel comfortable sharing ideas, asking questions, and collaborating.

### In Summary

Here is the list in full. There are no doubt many more I could include, and there is a list unique to each person's lived experiences and career journey.

- Curiosity
- Courage
- Ideation
- Iteration
- Flow
- Balancing Process and Product
- Problem 'Defining'
- Questioning
- Nurturing

This blog developed out of a lightning talk I gave. It prompted an interesting discussion between myself and my colleagues. One key takeaway for me was the suggestion that I should start gathering real examples of creativity in coding to illustrate this list. Hopefully, I'll include these in a follow up post soon.
